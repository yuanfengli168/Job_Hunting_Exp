  - 友多闻，分享平台：
    - 可以分享任何地方看到的任何讯息。好像一个 facebook 群组，但是我们可以分享 tiktok，news，还有别的。 同时根据你的喜好，我们会用机器学习为每一个人量身定制推荐内容。如果你有好友，可以根据你的潜在行为看出你比较认可谁，然后再结合你最近是否在找工作给你推荐你的信息。
    - 没啦！

  1. 下载了很喜欢的抖音视频，苹果手机无法分类，导致找很久找不到自己喜欢的。没办法 share 给别人看，没办法干其他的。（一个视频分类器怎么样？）
  2. 事多知 （推荐系统），友直友良友多问。（饭要少吃，是要多知； NBA 球星你也不懂，NFL 球星你也不懂，吃饭你也不懂，共济会你也没听说过，求职，吃饭都没办法。你想想咋办。）

  How to let my model help you get prepared for upcoming interviews? in a personalized way? How do you get a AI mentor which you are seeking for a long time?

  - This AI Mentor knows what you have learnt even though you have no clue you had learned that earlier.
  - This AI also help you lists few PinPoints listed in Job Descriptions that you might get an interview for.
  - This AI helps you list all things you capable to do related to the JDs.
  - It also remind you through Quizlet periodically
  - It records how well you do and become a better mentor while you are having more and more interviews.
  - It helps you to wrote down all documentation and summaries for the interviews. So its like dynamic programming, and you just review and become better in the future.
