# IMT573 + IMT547 review

## Goal:

- how to use R and applied statistics to formulate meaningful conclusions from data?
- How to appy statistics in a social science setting?

## steps:

1. Data Visualization for exploring data in 573slide3.
2. EDA in 573slide3.
3. histogram and KDE(Kernel density estimator)

### **Data visuals Comparison:**

(Following summaries from 573Slide3)
Vs | Pros | Cons
---|------|------
Histogram | For univariate 1D data, great for single and one category | Not for single variable across multiple categories  
Side-by-Side histogram | |
KDE | Density Estimation |
Density plot | |
Scatter plot | Bivariate |
Boxplot | 2 variables Bivariate; Continuous x Categorical |
BarChart | 2 variables, continuous X categorical |
Stacked Barchart | |
Group Barchart | |
Facets | subplots that each display one subset of the data | |

### **Method for Data visulization in R | Python**

| DV method            | R                     | Python   |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| scatterplot          | geom_point()          | plt.plot |
| bar chart            | bar geoms, geom_bar() |
| horizontal bar chart |                       |
| line chart           | line geoms,           |
| Pie chart            |                       |
| Donut charts         |                       |
| Stacked bar charts   |                       |
| Stream visualization |                       |

(mapping argument is always paired with aes())

## Concepts:

- In Tidy Data:

  - Each variable must have its own column
  - Each observation must have its own row.
  - Each value must have its own cell

- 573slide5 - Data types in visualization:
  - Variable:
    - Categorical(qualatative):
      - Nominal:
      - Ordinal:
    - Numerical (quantitative):
      - Discrete:
      - Continuous:

**Accuracy of Visual Decoding**

## I like this motto:

- Human brain is exceptionally good at visual pattern

- Tidying: Structuring your dataset to facilitate analysis. 整理:结构化您的数据集，以方便分析。 (I like facilitate, Tanu mitra always teach me things even after school.)
